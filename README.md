# 🤖 Multi-Collection RAG System with Conversational AI

## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates an advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that seamlessly integrates multiple data collections with conversational AI. The system provides personalized health coaching by analyzing user data across health metrics, location patterns, research papers, and conversation history.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🏥 **Multi-Collection RAG**: Searches across 5 distinct data sources simultaneously
- 🤖 **Conversational AI**: Natural language processing with personalized responses
- 🧠 **Advanced Memory**: Context retention across sessions with semantic clustering
- ⚡ **Real-Time Performance**: Sub-2-second response times with smooth UX
- 📱 **Modern UI**: Dark-themed interface with animations and responsive design
- 🔒 **Privacy-First**: All data processing happens locally in the browser

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Direct Download
1. Download the `rag-system.html` file
2. Open it in any modern web browser
3. Start chatting with your personal health assistant!


**That's it!** No installation, no dependencies, no setup required. 🎉

## 🧪 Example Interactions

### Health Analysis
```
👤 User: "How's my health looking lately?"

🤖 Assistant: Your health metrics are looking excellent! Resting heart rate 
   of 71 bpm, averaging 7+ hours of sleep, and staying very active with 
   11,000+ steps daily. Your workout routine is solid with cardio, strength, 
   and yoga. Any specific health aspect you'd like to focus on?

📊 Sources: Wearable Data, User Profile
```

### Pattern Recognition
```
👤 User: "What trends do you see in my data?"

🤖 Assistant: I'm seeing some interesting trends! Your workout intensity 
   has been gradually increasing - average heart rate during cardio went 
   from 140 to 150 bpm recently. Your stress is lowest after yoga sessions 
   and weekend park visits. Sleep quality correlates well with evening 
   workout timing.
